## Build System Architecture

For detailed technical documentation on how the image build pipeline works, see:
**[Build Pipeline Documentation](/.claude/plans/spicy-whistling-dove.md)**

The build system uses a **5-stage automated pipeline** (Source → Parse → Validate → Copy → Runtime) that:
- Auto-detects images from filesystem (no manual configuration needed)
- Validates all media files before building
- Copies assets to public folder for serving
- Generates TypeScript-compatible JSON for components
- Provides graceful fallbacks for missing images

This architecture is **extensible** and can be replicated for other content types (team members, equipment, services) following the same pattern.

**Last Updated**: 2024-12-12
**Status**: Phase 1-6 Complete + eLibrary/FAQ/Careers Pages Implemented
**Next Step**: Test all pages in dev server, then populate with real content
