✅ What Kind of Website You Should Design for NS Engineering

Think of this as the ideal interactive website for an engineering & geotechnical services company. The goal is:
credibility, clarity of capabilities, trust through project evidence, and easy lead conversion.

Below is the recommended structure.

🔵 1. Overall Website Style & Identity
Brand Tone

Professional

Technical

Field-oriented (engineering imagery)

Clean & minimal

Design Style

Light background

Blue/teal engineering palette

Thin-line technical illustrations

Strong typography

Consistent icons for tests, equipment, and services

Interactivity

Animations that help the user understand services

Sliders, modals for project details

Interactive maps

Service calculators (optional)

🔵 2. Homepage (Interactive & Impactful)
Hero Section (Top Banner)

Large image/video of field operations — drilling, PDA test, lab, rebar scanning

Big message:
“Nepal’s Trusted Partner for Geotechnical, Pile Testing & Material Investigations”

Clear call-to-action:

Request a Quote

See Our Services

Quick-Service Blocks (Interactive)

Clickable cards for:

Pile Testing (PDA, PIT, Static Load Test)

Soil Testing

Rock Testing

Drilling & Field Investigation

Non-Destructive Tests

Geophysical Tests (MASW, ERT, SRT)

When you hover → a short description + a “Learn More” button pops out.

🔵 3. Services Section (Most Important for NS Engineering)

Make this interactive, not just text.

Structure

Each service should be a card that expands into a detailed popup/modal.

Example service cards:

🟦 Pile Testing

PDA (High-Strain Dynamic Test)

PIT (Low-Strain)

Static Load Test

Cross-Hole Sonic Logging

Rebar Detection

Interaction:
Click → opens with diagrams of PDA signals, PIT wave reflections, etc.

🟦 Soil & Rock Laboratory

Compaction, CBR

Triaxial

UCS

SPT / Field Vane

Grain Analysis

Interaction:
Hover → show sample results or example lab sheets.

🟦 Drilling & Field Investigation

Rotary/Core Drilling (upto 600m)

Borehole Logging

Permeability tests

Sample collection

Interaction:
Clickable 3D borehole illustration.

🟦 Geophysical Surveys

MASW

ERT

Seismic Refraction

Interaction:
Scroll-trigger animations explaining how waves travel and how profiling works.

🔵 4. Completed Projects Section (Credibility Driver)

Use an interactive project timeline or gallery.

Project Card Structure

Project name

Scope of work

Photos

Equipment used

Client name

Completion year

Key outcomes

Interaction

A timeline slider (2014 → present)

On click, a full project case study opens

Can filter by:

Pile testing

Drilling

Lab testing

Geophysical

Roads/bridges/hydropower

This section is extremely important because the PDF shows NS Engineering has done complex and high-value projects.

🔵 5. Equipment Section (Big Differentiator)

Create an Equipment Catalog with:

Photos

Technical specifications

Test capacity

Optional downloadable PDFs

Examples:

Pile Driving Analyzer (PDA)

Sonic Loggers

Core drilling rigs

SRT/ERT equipment

Lab machines (UCS, triaxial, CBR, etc.)

Interaction:

A carousel

Spec sheet popup

“Request this equipment for a job” button

🔵 6. About Us Section

Highlight:

10+ years of experience

Geotechnical experts

Field/lab capabilities

Accreditations or affiliations

Team (shown with card grid)

Storytelling

Explain how NS Engineering evolved, areas of operation, industries served.

🔵 7. Contact & RFQ (Request for Quote)

Make contacting extremely easy.

Features

Multi-step form:

Type of service needed

Location

Expected timeline

Upload documents (BOQ, drawings, specs)

Google Map

WhatsApp button

Email + phone

Office address

Advanced Idea

→ Instant quotation estimator
Users can choose a test and get estimated pricing.

🔵 8. Optional But Highly Valuable Interactive Features
1. Equipment Scheduling Calendar

Clients can see availability of rigs/test machines.

2. Project Location Map

Interactive map showing where NS Engineering has worked across Nepal.

3. Client Dashboard

Clients can:

Upload files

Check progress

Download test results

View invoices

4. Knowledge Center (SEO Boost)

Blog + case studies + testing guides.
